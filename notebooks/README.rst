Notebooks
=========

In each database folder (i.e. KEGG PATHWAYS, Reactome and WikiPathways), the following can be located:

1. Example conversions of the original database file formats into Biological Expression Language (BEL) graphs
2. Statistics for nodes and edges extracted from the original file formats and for those converted into BEL graphs

Furthermore, the *similarity_analysis* folder contains the analysis of the 21 equivalent pathways across the three databases that is outlined
in the manuscript.
