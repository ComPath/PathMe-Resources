PathMe Resources
================
This package is a supplement to PathMe. Contained in the notebooks folder, for each database (i.e. KEGG PATHWAYS, Reactome and WikiPathways), the following can be located:

1. Example conversions of the original database file formats into Biological Expression Language (BEL) graphs
2. Statistics for nodes and edges extracted from the original file formats and for those converted into BEL graphs
